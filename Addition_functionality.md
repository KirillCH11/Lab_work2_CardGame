# Ideas:
- Introduce a couple of dialogues: with the Magician and the Duke. Depending on the results of the player's choice, the combat characteristics of the hero / opponent will change.
- Add a full-fledged Introduction and Conclusion, where you describe the purpose and outcome of the hero's adventure, respectively (At the moment, each of these stages is implemented in one sentence, it may be difficult for the player to understand the plot)
- To implement a system of achievements: after completing the user will receive one or another title, depending on his actions during the game
- Make some random event that affects the passage: for example, with varying probability, depending on the choice of the game path, during the passage the hero will meet Bandits, who, depending on the player's behavior, will give him an item of equipment, or vice versa, will take away
- I also had the idea to change the initial parameters of the character depending on the speed of the CPU cooler at the moment, but this requires installing an additional library, and this, as far as I remember, is not allowed.
